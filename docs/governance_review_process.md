# Governance and Review Process (v1.0)


## 1. Roles and Responsibilities

- **Contributors**: Anyone who submits issues, PRs, or feedback.
- **Reviewers**: Core team members with write access. Responsible for reviewing and approving PRs.
- **Maintainers**: Final decision-makers. They can merge PRs and resolve disputes.

## 2. Pull Request Review Guidelines

A good PR should:
- Be atomic (do one thing).
- Include a clear description and rationale.
- Pass all tests and lint checks.
- Include updates to documentation where applicable.
- Respect the structure and style of the codebase.

Use labels like `enhancement`, `bug`, or `needs review` to clarify intent.

## 3. Conflict and Dispute Resolution

- Disagreements are discussed in the PR thread or GitHub Discussions.
- If no consensus is reached, maintainers make the final decision.
- All decisions must be justified and documented in the PR.

## 4. Updates to This Document

This document is version-controlled. Major changes require a PR and review from at least two maintainers.
