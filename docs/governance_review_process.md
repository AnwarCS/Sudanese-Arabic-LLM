# Governance and Review Process (v1.0)


## 1. Roles and Responsibilities

- **Contributors**: Anyone who submits issues, PRs, or feedback.
- **Reviewers**: Core team members with write access. Responsible for reviewing and approving PRs.
- **Maintainers**: Final decision-makers. They can merge PRs and resolve disputes.

## 2. Pull Request Review Guidelines

A good PR should:
- Be atomic (do one thing).
- Include a clear description and rationale.
- Pass all tests and lint checks.
- Include updates to documentation where applicable.
- Respect the structure and style of the codebase.

Use labels like `enhancement`, `bug`, or `needs review` to clarify intent.

## 3. Conflict and Dispute Resolution

- Disagreements are discussed in the PR thread or GitHub Discussions.
- If no consensus is reached, maintainers make the final decision.
- All decisions must be justified and documented in the PR.

## 4. Updates to This Document

This document is version-controlled. Major changes require a PR and review from at least two maintainers.
## 5. Communication Guidelines

- **Preferred Channels**: Use GitHub Issues for bugs/features, GitHub Discussions for broader topics, and Slack/Discord for real-time questions.
- **Response Times**: Reviewers aim to respond to PRs and issues within 2 business days.
- **Code of Conduct**: All contributors must follow our [Code of Conduct](../CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## 6. Release Management

- **Versioning Strategy**: We follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).
- **Release Cadence**: Releases occur on demand based on feature readiness.
- **Release Process**: Maintainers create a release branch, run tests, update the changelog, and tag a new release on GitHub.

## 7. Issue Management

- **Issue Triage**: New issues are reviewed weekly or daily if possible and labeled by maintainers.
- **Bug Reports**: Include  environment, steps to reproduce, and logs.
- **Feature Requests**: Include a clear goal, rationale, and suggested implementation.
